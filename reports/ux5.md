# User Experience - Team *T26* 

The report summarizes user experience testing performed on the team's application.

Each developer should ask the user to accomplish one or more simple tasks while monitoring their efforts.  
The user should attempt to complete the tasks without any aid from the developer.
Use a pseudonym to identify the user below. 
Set a time limit and tasks for the user to perform.

 
### Tasks

Each user should complete the following tasks in 10 minutes.
Developers should not guide the user, but the user may ask for help as a last resort.  
Consider this a failure when it happens.  

1. Load the wwbrews trip (make sure the .json file is downloaded to PC first) and optimize the round-trip distance so it's shorter.
2. Change the map background to satellite or whatever layer you want, and change the line colors to any color you want.

### Demographics

Age, nationality, and other background information can sometimes be helpful understanding the problems a user encountered.

| Pseudonym | Demographics | Age |

### Observations

Note the users interactions with the system for each of the tasks.
Record the success, failures, and problems the user encountered for each task.

Add issues to GitHub for any changes necessary to the system.

| 1 and 2 | Didn't fail either task, but they questioned why we had two dropdowns instead of just one. They found load trip quickly, but searched for the layer/color options in the same dropdown instead of the slider dropdown. | Med | | 
| 1 | Was able to find upload button eventually but first clicked the 'My Trip' edit name button. She then found the upload button and selected the file. She was confused at what happened since the map did not scale to fit the data. She looked for the optimize feature in the same menu she found load but then saw the other menu button and guessed which symbol to click and she successfully optimized the map. | Low | |
| 2 | She tried right clicking the map but then went to the menu with the color change and layer change and changed to line color and the map background to the 'Hell' layer and enjoyed it. | Low | |
| 1 | Mark has created a couple of API's for his job so he was very excited when I asked him to test one out. He found the load trip relitively quickly. He didn't like how the map did not zoom out once it loaded, but he zoomed out manually and found the optimize button relitively quickly as well. | Low | |
| 2 | He messed around with the map for a little bit, creating pictures with the distance lines, deleteing them then drawing more images. He changed the line colors to a few different colors and changed the map to satelite very easily. | Low | |
