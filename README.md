As a team we at VNER have various work preferences that we take advantage of to create a healthy dynamic with appropriate expectations for each member. Our team uses a combination of Scrum meetings, Slack communication, Agile methodologies, ZenHub, and principles from "Clean Code" by Robert Martin to ensure our goals are clear, managable, and understandable.

Our team values open and regular communication above all. Communication is integral to the processes we use and to the success of our product. We follow the Scrum framework and develop in 3-week sprints, during which we will meet regularly and be transparent about our progress. We provide updates on our progress towards sprint goals, and we are not hesitant to share impediments or personal challenges we run into along the way. All of us take ownership of this project, and it's our responsibility to stay up to speed and check the repository for new issues and pull requests frequently. Our team uses Slack as our primary means of communication, and we can reach each other via Teams and text messaging as well.

Agile methodologies provide us with flexibility to overcome all obstacles we encounter. The Scrum framework allows us to develop incrementally, with transparency and a single goal. We stay organized using ZenHub to track issues and view progress during each sprint. The combination of the Scrum methodology and use of ZenHub, fosters an environment that plays to each of our strengths and lets us continuously make improvements to our team's productivity.

Our team at VNER is composed of passionate, talented, and hard-working members who set high expectations for ourselves and the quality of work we produce. Each individual on our team brings unique knowledge and strengths that allow us to synergistically overcome developmental problems. In addition, the VNER team members have some variety of preferred work hours and roles, so by managing our time and resource allocation we can maximize the quantity and quality of work produced.
